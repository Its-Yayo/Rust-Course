# Rust-Course
Repo to store all activities from my Rust's journey. I'll be learning all this stuff from this [book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html).
Every directory will store a single project for my activities, as well as some annotations. 

## Quick Note
I already did an introductory activity in Rust, check it out [here](https://github.com/Its-Yayo/Macro-Calc)

## Run local
You need [cargo](https://crates.io/) and [rustc](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) in order to compile and run this program. I already did some ```$ cargo init``` to initialize Rust projects. You need to build and run 'em
```bash
$ cargo build
$ cargo run
```

## Save local
You need [git](https://git-scm.com/) downloaded. Check out the following commands in order to clone my project
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/Its-Yayo/Rust-Course.git
$ cd Rust-Course
```

Also u need to update any changes to your local
```bash
$ git pull origin
```

## License
Proyect without license

Happy coding fellas :)
